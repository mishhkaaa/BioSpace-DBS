0," Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013) The principal species for biomedical research was the mouse . Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight ."
1," A tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects . Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . The findings highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants ."
2, CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery . Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN iReport . Submit your best shots for next week's gallery of snapshots of the world's most recent travel destinations .
3," S. aureus MSCL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis . DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays . The “replication fork” checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to mutagenesis ."
4," Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption . We hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space . Study looked at impact of three gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1/g] on mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station ."
